            <div class="about=me__body">
                <p>Hello there! My name is Thomas Tran, and I am a passionate and driven Software Engineer.
                    My main work lies in C++ applications and web development. Having graduated with a 
                    Computer Science Bachelor's Degree from California State University 
                    of Fullerton, I have acquired many different skills and habits that are
                    vital to success in this industry. I can communicate extremely effectively
                    with people of all different ages and backgrounds, allowing me to bridge any gaps 
                    of knowledge they might have. What I lack in experience, I make up for with my 
                    patience, adaptability, and drive to learn and succeed.</p>
                <p>Over the course of my time at CSUF, I have become extremely proficient in 
                    C++, Python, HTML, and CSS. The classes I took also gave me insight into 
                    vital aspects of Computer Science such as SQL and Databases, Algorithm Concepts,
                    and Object-Oriented Programming. Currently, I am also sharpening my skills in 
                    JavaScript and am learning frameworks such as React.js and Flask. I enjoy gaming 
                    in my free time and am learning game development through Unreal Engine 5.</p>
